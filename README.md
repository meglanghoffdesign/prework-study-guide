# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project serves as a comprehensive study guide surronding the key web development concepts of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It was built as part of my motivation to reinforce foundational coding skills while learning how to structure and organize technical information effectively.

The goal of this project was to create an organized, easy-to-use guide for reviewing essential web development topics surrounding HTML, Git, CSS, and Javascript. While this project aims to list useful information, this guide also serves as an interactive space for experimenting and gaining hands-on experience with these tools.

Through building this project, I learned how to structure a webpage using HTML and CSS, how to interactivity to my site with Javascript, how to organize content into clear sections with reusable and scalable code, and how to use Git to manage and track changes in my project.
