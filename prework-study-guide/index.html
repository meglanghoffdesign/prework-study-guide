        <ul>
          <li>The <head> head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The <body> body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language which is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.</li>
          <li>HTML uses tags to define elements. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >). HTML elements typically have an opening tag and a closing tag with content placed in between.</li>
          <li>Every HTML document should include key elements such as !DOCTYPE, html, head, and body.</li>
          <li>HTML headings range from h1 to h6. The h1 tag is for the main heading and h6 is for the least important heading. These help define the hierarchy of content.</li>
          <li>HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information about elements and are included in the opening tag.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>It best to avoid inline styles and keep the CSS in a separate stylesheet for easier maintenance.</li>
          <li>Keep it DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself—reuse styles where possible.</li>
          <li>Utilize dev tools by using browser dev tools to inspect and debug your CSS</li>

        <h3>How to Start</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>cd DIRECTORY NAME</strong> to navigate to the correct directory.</li>
          <li><strong>git status</strong> to check git branch (should be on main).</li>
          <li>Not on the main branch? <strong>git checkout main</strong> to switch to main.</li>
          <li><strong>git pull origin main</strong> to pull down latest main branch to local.</li>
          <li><strong>git checkout -b BRANCH NAME(ex. feature/add-html)</strong> to create new feature branch.</li>
          <li>Adding CSS? <strong>touch style.css</strong> into assets directory.</li>
          <li>Adding Javascript? <strong>touch script.js</strong> into assets directory.</li>
          <li><strong>code .</strong> to open VS Code.</li>

        <h3>How to Save</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>cd DIRECTORY NAME</strong> to navigate to the correct directory.</li>
          <li><strong>git add -A</strong> to push all content to the next commit.</li>
          <li><strong>git commit -m “< MESSAGE >”</strong> to add context to commit/commits locally. (no space around message)</li>
          <li><strong>git pull origin main</strong> to pull down latest main branch to local.</li>
          <li><strong>git push origin BRANCH NAME(ex. feature/add-html)</strong> to push changes to remote repository.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a container used to store data that can be used or updated later.</li>
          <li>Semicolons (;) are used to separate statements in JavaScript.</li>
          <li>const declares a constant variable whose value cannot be changed after it's assigned.</li>
          <li>A string is a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, symbols) surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li>console.log(variable) prints the value of variable to the browser’s console (useful for debugging)</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which code is executed based on conditions or loops.</li>
          <li>An <strong>if statement</strong> prints a block of code if a condition is true.</li>
          <li>An <strong>else if statement</strong> provides another condition to check if the first if condition is false.</li>
          <li>= is used for assignment while === checks strict equality, meaning both value and type must be the same</li>
          <li>An array is a list of items (values) stored in a single variable.</li>
          <li>The index is the position of an element in an array, ALWAYS starting at 0.</li>
          <li>A for loop is used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>While const declares a constant variable that cannot be changed, let declares a variable whose value can be updated.</li>
          <li>A Boolean is a data type that can only be true or false.</li>
          <li>x++ is short for x + 1</li>
          <li>For loops have three parts: The for keyword. A three-part conditional statement: (let x = 0), condition (x < 5), and update (x++). A code block to execute on each loop iteration.</li>
